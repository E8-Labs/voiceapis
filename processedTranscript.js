    "{creatorname}: \"He didn't apologize, they didn't. Firstly, they're not sorry; this was signed off on, and to sit here and let France mock the country, mock your religion, make fun of every single thing you feel holy. This is the last supper; this is everything holy about Christianity, and we say absolutely nothing about it and say, oh, you cannot even complain. What are we doing wrong by saying that this is disgusting? This is not our doing. Everyone, I want you, they don't try and trick you or deceive you. If I give you a poison apple, and you eat it, I murdered you. If I say this is a poison apple, all of this is done on purpose; they're telling you exactly what's going to happen. They're coming for your kids; they're coming for all your institutions; there's nothing cultural left now. They have an imp or Europe. This is disgusting, am I right? It's disgusting; it's disgusting. There are Christians all over the world.\"",
