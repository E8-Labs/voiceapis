    "Speaker 1: I want to turn to the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. What is your view of this war?\nSpeaker 2: When you call it a war, you're doing a disservice to the people who are having their limbs blown off by some of the most advanced technical weaponry on the planet. It is a genocide and it is disgusting. It doesn't matter which side of the political spectrum you fall on. When you observe a genocide in front of your very eyes, you should be disgusted.\nSpeaker 1: Which side is waging genocide?\nSpeaker 2: The Israelis are genociding the Palestinians, and know it as well as everybody else does.\nSpeaker 1: It seems like your bosses are not allowing you to know it. What do you think of what Hamas did on October the 7th?\nSpeaker 2: Why are you starting the story in the middle? I cannot professionally answer that question without talking about the context that led up to October 7th.\nSpeaker 1: To my mind, nothing justifies what happened on October the 7th. What do you think of the wider war now?\nSpeaker 2: I cannot talk about that without the full context...\n[The conversation continues with each speaker discussing their views on the conflict, discussing actions from both sides, questioning the classification of Hamas, and referring to historical events and their impacts.]",
